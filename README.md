# remove-redundant-line-breaks
Obsidian plugin to remove redundant line breaks.

All you do is install it and you can run the "Remove Redundant Line Breaks" command from the command palette while a note is open, it should effectively remove the extra line breaks.

This is useful when you've imported notes that ended up double spaced.
